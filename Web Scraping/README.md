## How the Internet Works? A Brief Summary

1. **Physical Layer**
    - Actual electrons on a wire
    - High/low voltages

2. **Data Link Layer**
    - Frames
    - MAC addresses and physical machines on a local network

3. **Network Layer**
    - Router to router
    - Creates network IP addresses
    - Variable-length packets

4. **Transport Layer**
    - Persistent communication channels
    - TCP, UDP, ports

5. **Session Layer**
    - Open, Close, manage sessions
    - AppleTalk, SCP

6. **Presentation Layer**
    - String encoding, encryption/decryption
    - Object serialization, files, compression

7. **Application Layer**
    - HTTP
    - POST and GET requests
    - REST APIs

### How to think about the internet
- Each request goes through many layers of wrapping and unwrapping to get to its destination and back
- These requests do not require a web browser
- Requests can be examined, replicated, and saved
- Anything the browser can do, we can do with a web scraper.
