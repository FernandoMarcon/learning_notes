## Stock Markets
System that enables companies to sell partial ownership in themselves to people in exchange for cash.

- Your liability is limited to the ammount of your investment.

**Shareholder Rights**
- Elect board of directors
- Change corporate charter

**Investment Returns**
- Earning part of a company's profit after getting an ownership stake via stock.
- Companies also raise money by **borrowing** it.
- Companies **borrow** money by selling **bonds**.

**Stocks** (ownership stake in a firm) + **Bonds** (loan to a firm) = Capital Markets

**The bid-ask spread**
- Bid: how much a buyer is willing to pay for a given stock
- Ask: how much an owner of a given stock is willing to sell
- Bid-ask spread: the difference between the best ask and bid of a given stock
- stock price: median value between best bid and ask prices for a given stock

**Types of orders**

- Limit order: the buy order for a given stock is only executed if its price reach some level of price

**Short and going long**
- _Going Long_: hope the price will rise
  - Buy stock *now* for $61.54
  - Sell in the future for $80 - make money ($80 - $61.54 = $18.46 per share profit)
  - Sell in the *future* for $40 - lose money ($40 - $61.54 = $21.54 per share loss)

- _Going short_: : hope the price will fall
  - Buy it back in the future for $50 - make money ($61.54 - $50 = $11.54 per share *profit*)
  - Buy it back in the *future* for $70 - lose money ($61.54 - $70 = $8.46 per share *loss*)

**Basic of stock valuation**
$$Valuation = \frac{Expected\ Dividend}{Required\ Rate\ of\ Return\ -\ Growth\ Rate}$$

> **_Required Rate of Return_**: how much stockers expect to receive in returns from a given firm.

> **_Earnings_**: are the amount of money a company earns over time. Reported in a quaterly basis. Beacause of seasonality, some companies will naturally earn more in some quarters than others.

**How often do stocks do poorly?**
- Do stocks outperform Treasury Bills (Bessinbinder Research)?
> **_Treasury Bills (T-Bills)_**: Short term bonds issued by the US Treasury that mature in less than a year
- PeopÄºe buy T-Bills as a way to earn just a very small return on their cash with no risk.
- Pretty close to leave your money in a savings account
- Traditionally, T-bills have very low returs
- Often times in recent years, it's been less than 2%
- About 50% of stocks do _not_ outperform T-bills
- About 50% of the stocks in your portfolio will _break-even_ investments or even _lose money_.
- How can the returns on the S&P 500 be almost 11% per year?
  - The performance of the US stock market is powered by a handful of superstar stocks
  - We don't know which stocks these will be in any given year, but they will be there
  - Picking stocks is _risky_
  - That's why it's often a good idea for small investors to buy a low cost exchange traded fund or mutual fund product and own the market as a whole.
