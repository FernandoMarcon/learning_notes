# Capital Markets
## Basics
Main questions before investing:
  1. Am I being realistic about how much I should earn?
  2. Am I prepared for the __risk__?
  3. Am I confortable with __daily changes__ in my portfolio?

> **_Types of Investors_**: individual and institutional

> **_Listed_**: Stocks trade on the exchange that buyers and sellers go through

> **_Bonds_**: Form of debt companies sell to investors in eschange for receiving a type of interest payment over time

> **_IPO_**: Initial Public Offering, the first time a stock is sold to the general public

+ Stock returns have an arithmetic of mean of 11.3% for the period 1928 to 2018.
+ Bonds are not traded on an exchange; they are purchased from the issuer and traded between investors.
+ The average IPO today is from companies older and more stable than IPOs offered in the past. Companies are waiting longer to go public, with the downside to investors that the company has already seen its highest growth.

### Exchanges
- **NASDAQ**: National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation, an over-the-counter (OTC) exchange
- **NYSE**: Wall Street (New York City), stocks phisically and eletronically traded

### The shrinking stock market
US Publicly traded companies:
  - 1998 -> ~10,000, 2018 -> ~ 4,000
  - Large companies buying smaller ones
  - Fewer going public

IPOs per Year
  - Historically: 300 to 500
  - Now: 100 or less

IPOs Now
  - Older
  - More stable (Facebook, Uber)
  - Today's IPOs have already seen strongest growth before going public.
  - Fastest growth is early on

### Regulations
+ [SEC](www.sec.gov)
  - writes rules for the investment markets based on laws passed by Congress
  - inform and protect investors
  - facilitate capital formation
  - enforce federal securities laws
  - regulate securities markets
  - provide data

+ [FINRA](www.finra.org)
  - regulates industries

+ [CFTC](cftc.gov) (Commodity Futures Trading Commision)
  - Industry oversight
  - law & regulation

## Stock Markets
System that enables companies to sell partial ownership in themselves to people in exchange for cash.

**Common stocks**
- A certificate that indicates ownership in part of a corporation
- have the highest rate of return
- Your liability is limited to the ammount of your investment.

**Shareholder Rights**
- Elect board of directors
- Change corporate charter

**Investment Returns**
- Earning part of a company's profit after getting an ownership stake via stock.
- Companies also raise money by **borrowing** it.
- Companies **borrow** money by selling **bonds**.

**Stocks** (ownership stake in a firm) + **Bonds** (loan to a firm) = Capital Markets

**The bid-ask spread**
- Bid: how much a buyer is willing to pay for a given stock
- Ask: how much an owner of a given stock is willing to sell
- Bid-ask spread: the difference between the best ask and bid of a given stock
- stock price: median value between best bid and ask prices for a given stock

**Types of orders**
- Market order: pay for a stock based on the current best ask price
- Limit order: the buy order for a given stock is only executed if its price reach some level of price

**Short and going long**
- _Going Long_: hope the price will rise
  - Buy stock *now* for $61.54
  - Sell in the future for $80 - make money ($80 - $61.54 = $18.46 per share profit)
  - Sell in the *future* for $40 - lose money ($40 - $61.54 = $21.54 per share loss)

- _Going short_: : hope the price will fall
  - Buy it back in the future for $50 - make money ($61.54 - $50 = $11.54 per share *profit*)
  - Buy it back in the *future* for $70 - lose money ($61.54 - $70 = $8.46 per share *loss*)

**Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)**
> Basket of individual stocks that can be bought to allow instant diversification

_Russel 1000 Value ETF_
- Buy online or via a broker
- Buy one share
- Fraction of a share of 1000 firms
- Instant diversification

_Mutual Fund_
- is a common choice made by people investing on their own.
- Investing in a Mutual Fund
  - Select a fund
  - Send money
  - Money is pooled
  - Managers invest pooled money
- Focus on asset classes
  - Domestic equities
  - Bonds
  - International equities
- Cost of Fund

**Basic of stock valuation**
$$Valuation = \frac{Expected\ Dividend}{Required\ Rate\ of\ Return\ -\ Growth\ Rate}$$

$Growth Rate = This\ Year's\ Revenue - Last\ Year's\ Revenue$
> **_Required Rate of Return_**: how much stockers expect to receive in returns from a given firm.

> **_Earnings_**: are the amount of money a company earns over time. Reported in a quaterly basis. Beacause of seasonality, some companies will naturally earn more in some quarters than others.

**How often do stocks do poorly?**
- Do stocks outperform Treasury Bills (Bessinbinder Research)?
> **_Treasury Bills (T-Bills)_**: Short term bonds issued by the US Treasury that mature in less than a year
- PeopÄºe buy T-Bills as a way to earn just a very small return on their cash with no risk.
- Pretty close to leave your money in a savings account
- Traditionally, T-bills have very low returs
- Often times in recent years, it's been less than 2%
- About 50% of stocks do _not_ outperform T-bills
- About 50% of the stocks in your portfolio will _break-even_ investments or even _lose money_.
- How can the returns on the S&P 500 be almost 11% per year?
  - The performance of the US stock market is powered by a handful of superstar stocks
  - We don't know which stocks these will be in any given year, but they will be there
  - Picking stocks is _risky_
  - That's why it's often a good idea for small investors to buy a low cost exchange traded fund or mutual fund product and own the market as a whole.

**Building your portfolio**
1. Value companies
2. Growth companies

+ _Value companies_
  + Modestly priced
  + Mature firms
  + More stable
  + Industries that aren't rapidly growing
  + Value Stocks
    + Railroad
    + Utility
    + Industrial equipment makers
    + Energy providers
+ _Growth companies_
  + Fast growing
  + Lower profit levels
  + Relatively expensive
  + Growth Stocks
    + Information technology
    + Internet companies
    + Popular consumer goods

- Historically, _growth stocks_ have **lower average returns** than value   stocks do.
  - Growth stocks: ~9% average returns
  - Value stocks: ~13% average returns

- _Value stocks_ tend to be _more volatile_ than the overall market.
  - Go through slumps
  - Negative returns for lonog periods
  - Fast appreciation over short period

- _Growh Stocks_
  - More frequent positive returns
  - Lower returns
  - Smaller dividends paid

+ Stocks should only be a part of your portfolio

> **_Call Option_**: Gives you the right but not the obligation to **buy** a stock at a particular price until some time in the future.

> **_Put Option_**: Gives you the right but not the obligation to **sell** a stock at a particular price until some time in the future.

-  Only institutional investors can trade post-close and pre-open.
-   The median price for stock is usually higher than the mean (the average).
-    The market opens at 9:30 a.m. Eastern on all non-holiday weekdays.
-     While growth stocks often do not pay dividends, they more often have positive returns than value stocks.

## Bond Markets
> **_Bond_**: Long-term promissory note, issued by a borrower, promising to its holder a predetermined and fixed amount of interest per year and repayment of principal at maturity.

Issued by corporations, government, state, local municipalities


**Major characteristics of bonds:**
- > **_Par value_**: Face value of the bond, returned to the bondholder at maturity
- > **_Price_**: Represented as a percentage of face value or par
- > **_Coupon_**: Percentage of the par value of bond that will be paid periodically in the form of interest.
  - $1,000 par value x 5% annual coupon rate = $50 annually
  - Zero Coupon Bonds:
    - Zero or low coupon rate
    - Don't pay interest
    - Issued at discount below par value
- > **_Maturity_**: Length of time until bond issuer returns the par value to the bondholder and terminates or redeems the bond
- > **_Yield_**: Rate of return the investor will earn on the bond after taking into account the price paid for the bond and the coupon on the bond

> **_Call Provision_**: Gives a corporation the option to redeem the bonds before the maturity date

**Bond Rating**
- Reflects future risk potential of bonds
- Moody's: AAA, AA1, AA2, AA3, A1, A2, A3, BAA1, BAA2, BAA3, BA1, BA2, BA3, B1, B3, CAA1, CAA2, CAA4, CA, ..., D
- The lower the bond rating is the higher the probability of default.
- When the bond defaults, that means that it stops paying coupon payments and interest to the investor, and investors may not get all their money back.
- Bond rating Agency's are jusding how risky the bond is and how likely the company is to pay back the money the investor has let to them by buyuing that company's bonds.
- Riskier bonds means an investor won't get paid (all)  their money back, and also that the rate of return demanded by capital markets is going to be higher.
- If a bond is riskier, you're going to need more in yield, or coupon payments, in order to buy that bond in the first place.

> **_Junk Bonds_**: High-risk bonds with ratings of BB or below by Moody's and Standard&Poor's
  - High-yield
  - Higher interest (3-5% more) than AAA-rated bonds

**Bond evaluation**

Ex:
- Maturity: 10
- Par: $1000
- Coupon: Par x 0.08 = 80
- Yield: 0.06
- **Value of Bond**: $1,147.20
- **Price**: $-114.72017

[Present Value](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040315/how-do-you-calculate-present-value-excel.asp): present-value(Yield, Maturity, Coupon, Par, 0)

**Bond Yield Calculations**
- Maturity: 10
- Coupon: 80
- Par Value: 1000
- Price: 1000
- **Yield**: 8%

[rate](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/051815/how-can-i-calculate-bonds-coupon-rate-excel.asp) = rate(Maturity, Coupon, -Price,Par Value)

### Three important relationships in bonds
+ The value of a bond is inversily related to changes in the level of interest rates
+ The coupon ties directly to the yield. The market value of the bond is less than par value if the yield on similar bonds is above the coupon interest rate.
+ Long term bonds have greater interest rate risks than short term bonds do.

### Treasury bond markets
Your income level and tax circumstances play a major role in determining how you should allocate the bond portion of your portfolio.

> **_Treasury Bond_**: are debt securities issued by the US government
- Safest securities
- About 4% returns over last 50 years.
- Exempt from state and local income taxes
  - Specially usefull in states like California, Oregon, Iowa, and New Jersey where the state income taxes are high.
  - Some major cities, like New York and Washington DC, have local income taxes, which also make treasury bonds an exceptionally good investment choice.
- The US Treasury Department finances government debt by issuing **short- and long-term** bonds.
- > **_T-Bills_**: Short-term obligations with maturities of 13, 26, or 52 weeks.
  - Don't pay coupon payments, instead pay face value at maturity.
  - Denominations as small as $1,000.
  - Sold at a discount basis
- > **_Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)_**: Longer-term bonds that pay semiannual coupons in addition to their face value at maturity
    - Pay coupons, which are semiannual
    - The interest rate on these bonds is the coupon rate. And that's paid in addition to their face value.
    - That face value is paid out at maturity.
    - Denominations as small as $1,000
    - Very safe and risk free
    - Substitute for CDs and savinds accounts.
    - Liquid, Easy to sell

[Tresury Direct](www.tresurydirect.gov)

> **_Treasury auctions_**: essentially the government is selling bonds to the general public and to institutional investors, and you put in a higher price, which is equivalent to a lower yield, if you wanna buy these bonds. The highest prices get awarded the bonds, and people who put in lower prices do not get awarded them. The prices that are set for the bonds is determined based on all the bids, across all the participants in the market.

### Municipal bond markets
For investors in the **highest income tax brackets**, the best choic of bonds is often **municipal bonds**.

> **_Municipal (Muni) Bonds_**: Bonds issued by state and local governments and other nonprofit entities (e.g. universities).
  - Safe
  - Odds of default less than 1%
  - Returns average 4-6% of amount invested

> _**Tax-Backed Bonds**_
  - Issued by states, contries, districts, cities, towns, school districts
  - Secured by tax revenue
- Revenue Bonds
  - Issued for special projects (such as a new water treatment plant)
  - Bondholders paid back from revenues generated by the project financed

**Tax Risk for Muni Bonds**
1. Individual federal income tax rate reduced. The lower the federal tax rate is, the less valuable that muni tax exemption is.

2. May eventually be taxable by the IRS:
  - **_1898 Supreme Court Decision_**: Muni bond coupon payments -> No federal income taxes
  - The US Supreme Court had a landmark 1898 decision which said municipal bonds are not taxable.
  - However, that doesn't mean that the decision couldn't be challenged or reviewed in the future by the IRS, and ultimately by the Supreme Court.


**Tex Yield Valuation**
$$Equivalent\ Tex\ Yield = \frac{Tax\ Exempt\ Yield}{1 - Marginal\ tax\ rate}$$

The municipal securities market is characterized by **low liquidity**.
  - Municipal securities trade rarely.
  - There are more municipal bonds out there than any other form of security.
  - There's over 80,000 municipal bond issuers, and over 800,000 municipal bonds.
  - In 2017, about 99% of municipal securities didn't trade on any given day.
  - Those bonds that do trade, the numbers are very low:
    - Average of 14 customer trades during first 60 days after issuance.
    - Newly issued municipal bonds are the mos actively traded
    - It's rather an buy-and-hold investment, rather than a trading investment.
    - Almost all municipal bonds do trade in the first month after issuance, but by the time we get to the second month it's only about 15% of them trading, and then after that it's even less.

The market for municipal debt is called the tax-exempt market.

**Pricing Information on Trades**

That secondary market where investors trade bonds between in and one another, for municipal bonds it's just not very trasnparent.

We do have price information comming from MSRB, but pre-trade information is not broadly available.

The MSRB is the Municipal Securities Ruling Board and they are:
  - Muni bond regulatory group
  - Since 1995

### Bond ratings and municipal bonds
- [Invesco](www.invesco.com)
- Municipal bonds have a default rate of 0.00%, whhere Corporate bonds have a rate of 0.38%
- All rated municipal bonds have a lower 10-year cumulative default rate htan AAA-rated corporate bonds.

### Trading in municipal bonds
[EMMA] (emma.msrb.org)

- The annual interest payments over the term of the bond, plus the money paid at redemption, will be more than what was paid for the bond. an investor pay more than par value for a bond when the annual interest payments on the bond yields more than the par value at maturity
- Long-terms bonds have greater interest rates than the interest rates with short-term bonds.  The higher interest rates reflect the greater risk associated with long-term bonds.
- What is the term for money an investor receives from a bond issuer at maturity? Par is the term for face value of bond received at maturity.
-  This is the future value you will receive from the bond.

## Other Capital Markets
### FX markets
- Foreign Exchange Market
- Many large companies use the foreign exchange market in order to hedge their risks against changes in the currency exchange rate. This lets large companies hedge their risks against changes in the exchange rates that are based on the countries' economies.
- FX traders often use what are called futures contracts, which lets them lever up: they can trade a million dollars at a time, even if they only have a few thousand dollars in their own personal accounts.
- Trading FX is about trading expectations on the economy.
- It's very risky, and small changes get magnified a lot through the power of futures.
- When your are dealing with FX trading you are often captilizing on very, very small mover over time.
- The bid-ask spread can be significant if you're not careful.

#### Trading Strategies
- **FX arbitrage**
  > **_Triangular Arbitrage_**: Capitalizing on differences in FX trading across three currencies
    - Option 1: USD to JPY: 1 USD = 108 JPY
    - Option 2: USD to EUR to JPY: 1 USD = 110 JPY

### Commodity markets
Commodities includes a variety of phisical products and they're bought and sold through exchanges.
- Agricutural products
- Metals (silver, gold, etc)
- Energy (natural gas, electriciy, etc)

Commodity prices are stationary and related to inflation.

Trading:
- **_SPOT trading_**: Buying goods for delivery _today_
- **_Futures trading_**: Buying goods for deliverly _in the future_.
- Because of the price for storing commodities, _futures prices_ are usually _higher_ than spot prices.

Factors that drive commodity prices:
- Economic growth
- Exploration or developments that can change the supplies/demands
- Weather
- Storage
- Any kind of short-term supply shocks
- Regulations

Investments:
  - Equity in commodity-related companies
  - Physical commodity via the spot market
  - Commodity derivatieves (futures, swaps, etc.)

Information:
- [Bloomberg](www.bloomberg.com/markets/commodities)

Commodities and contango:
  - Contango (aka forwardation) is a situation where the futures price of a commodity is higher than the expected spot price at maturity
  - it dramatically impacts some of the products, such as USO (US Oil)
    - part of the contributing factor might be that essentially it has to pay for storage costs through the futures prices
  -  Contango leads the futures price to be higher than the spot price because of certain other contributing factors.
