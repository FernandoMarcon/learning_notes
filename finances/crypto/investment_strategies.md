# Choosing the Cryptocurrency
Based on:
- Liquidity and Trading Volume
- Volatility
- Availability
- Spread and Fees
- Potential

## Best Cryptocurrency to trade based on Liquidity
> Liquidity: how much value is exchanged during a certain time frame.

- high liquidity in the market → creates less volatility and the risk for a large market gap decreases
- liquidity correlates well with market capitalization → the larger the market cap is, the higher the liquidity.

__Pros__: High liquidity reduces the risk of the market gap
__Cons__: Low liquidity creates larger turns and entails higher risk
_Example_: Bitcoin and the top cryptocurrencies offers high liquidity and high trading volume.

## Best Cryptocurrency to trade based on Volatility
> Volatility: how much an asset or a cryptocurrency moves at a certain time interval.

- volatility → change in price → what creates a potential for profitable trades
- Bitcoin (BTC) is the least volatile cryptocurrency.
- Volatility often correlates with total market value → the higher the market value is, the lower the volatility.

__Pros__: High volatility creates prerequisite for profit
__Cons__: High volatility increases the risk of large losses
_Example_: Bitcoin and the top cryptocurrencies offers low volatility compared to the altcoins with lower market cap.

## Best Cryptocurrency to trade based on Availability
__Pros__: If accessibility is high, you can choose between several platforms
__Cons__: You may need to choose a platform that lacks trading features you are looking for
_Example_: Bitcoin and the top cryptocurrencies offers high availability compared to the altcoins with lower market cap.

## Best Cryptocurrency to trade based on Spread and Fees
> spread: difference between a buy and a sell order in the order book.
- For some trading platforms, this is the only “fee” you pay while using their service.
- It can vary between different trading platforms
- very important for high-frequency traders since they might have several hundreds of trades during the day.

__Pros__: Tight spreads reduce costs and increase your trading margin
__Cons__: High spread and fees can eat up your winning margin if you are a high-frequency trader.
_Example_: Bitcoin and the top cryptocurrencies offers tighter spread compared to the altcoins with lower market cap.

## Best Cryptocurrency to trade based on Potential
__Pros__: With great potential, you can do a higher profit in terms of percentual gain.
__Cons__: When you are looking for small altcoins with high potential you need to conduct thorough research. It is very easy to fall for ICO scams or promising projects that will, most likely, fail. This is a borderline to a lottery.
_Example_: Bitcoin and the top cryptocurrencies offers lower potential than the most promising altcoins. Nevertheless, many altcoins don’t have any potential at all.

# Best Cryptocurrency for Day Trading and Swing Trading

__HODL Strategy__: You should look for availability and great potential. The spread and fees are not important at all. The liquidity and volatility are nothing to consider either. If the cryptocurrency is very volatile you should split your investment into several deposits to minimize the risk buying at the peak.

__Swing Trader__: You should look for high liquidity, trading volume, availability and low fees. You don’t need extreme low fees but still, they will cut your margin.

__Day trader__: You should look for high liquidity, very high trading volume, high volatility, and extremely low spread or fees. The long-term potential is not highly important.
