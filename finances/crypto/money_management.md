# Money Management

## Risk
- 2% risk = 2% is the most you can lose on a trade
- When you lose, you usually won't lose 2%
### ATR
- How many pips, top to bottom a currency pair moves per candle, on average
- 1.5X the ATR for a currency pair
- Your Stop Loss should be 1.5x the ATR away from price is now.
- ATR to find pip value
  * Find out what 2% of your account is. Call this your __RISK__.
  * Figure out 1.5X ATR of the currency pair
  * __RISK__/1.5 ATR = Pip Value
### Over-leverage
#### How to
- Do NOT trade the same currency more than once at 2% risk
- Don't:
  - EUR/USD short, AUD/USD short, USD/JPY long all at 2% risk
  - you now have 6% of your trade on the USD!!
#### How Not to
- Go with the first trade entry for that currency and ride it
- Go half/half (1% and 1%)
- Go half-risk, and leave the door open for another trade later

> PIP
- Percentage in point/price interest point
- Forex currency pairs are quoted in terms of 'pips,' short for percentage in points.
- a pip is one-hundredth of one percent, or the fourth decimal place (0.0001).
- Currency base pairs are typically quoted where the bid-ask spread is measured in pips.
